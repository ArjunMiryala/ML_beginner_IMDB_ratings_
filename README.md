This Python project uses a pretrained model to analyze IMDB reviews. The model processes each review in the dataset and classifies it as either positive (1) or negative (0). It then provides statistics on the number of positive and negative reviews. Additionally, you can view performance metrics and efficiency details on Comet. To access the Comet link, simply run the code in your IDE, and the link will appear in the terminal. Thanks!
