Why do you need labels (num_labels=2)?
You're using AutoModelForSequenceClassification, which is a classification model. This means your task involves categorizing input text into predefined labels.



<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<distilbart and transformers model for sequence classification>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The num_labels=2 means you're setting up a binary classification task (e.g., positive/negative, spam/ham, real/fake).
If you were doing multi-class classification, you'd set num_labels to the number of classes (e.g., num_labels=3 for sentiment analysis: positive, neutral, negative).
Why do you need this model if you already have sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6?
sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 is a pretrained text summarization model based on DistilBART (a smaller, faster version of BART).
AutoModelForSequenceClassification is designed for classification tasks, not summarization.
Since text summarization and text classification are different tasks, you need different models:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<summary>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
If you want to summarize text, use sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6.
If you want to classify text (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis), you need a classification model like AutoModelForSequenceClassification.


<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Tokenization Explaiation>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Yes, your statement is generally true. Initializing a tokenizer helps convert input data into tokens, which allows a model to better understand and process text. 
Tokenization is a fundamental step in NLP, breaking down text into smaller components like words or subwords, making it easier for machine learning models to analyze and learn from the data
